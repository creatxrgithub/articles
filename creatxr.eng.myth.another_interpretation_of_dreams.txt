another interpretation of dreams

the question is come from 'zhuangzi - dreaming of butterflies': we are dreaming, or we are in someone else's dream?

i've ever talked about life and energy in a article 'about the spirit or ghost'. maybe life may exist in the form of pure energy life. but usually the energy require a carrier, that's as phisycal body.

maybe there are many parallel universes of our world. we are dreaming when a part of our energy escapes to another universe for some reason. the dream is over when the part of energy return. after the dream, if we feel excited, it means that we got some new energy. otherwise, if we feel tired, it means that we lost some energy. sometime we feel that we have a sense of 'being lost', it's because we had a part of energy remain in other parallel universe and lost contact.

anwners of two questions:

1) about 'repeat dreaming'

it's because we did the same choice according to our will and situation after our part of energy arrived other parallel universe.

but sometime it seems that something cannot repeat. for example: kill someone in dream. someone has been killed, why it could be repeated? it's because the one you killed is a part of someone's energy. it means that if you are dreaming 'kill someone', someone is in dream 'being killed'. so 'kill some in dream' maybe is a really case of murder.

2) the diffenence with 'the one': someone has the same energy but exist in several parallel universes

my answer is: someone is in only one universe. while we are dreaming, a part of our energy arrived other universe. it's dream cause the part of energy could return. if the part of energy lost contact, we don't know if the part of energy will dissipate or become as new independent energy. if all your energy arrived other universe, you will think that the history in your original universe is a dream.
